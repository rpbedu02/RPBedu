# RPBedu WebApp

The RPBedu WebApp is a centralized hub for accessing and managing educational web applications, designed to empower teachers and students. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore, add, edit, and import tools, with seamless JSON-based imports and a responsive design. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app supports both local and URL-based JSON imports, flexible tool management, and accessibility features.

## Features

Tool Management: Add, edit, and delete educational tools with fields for name, description, icon, status (active or coming-soon), and URL.

JSON Imports: Import tools from local JSON files or a URL, with a default JSON hosted at rpbedu-tools-list.json.

Automatic Import on Launch: Loads tools from the default JSON URL on every app launch, starting with a blank slate for flexibility.

Relaxed URL Validation: Supports coming-soon tools with invalid or missing URLs (defaults to #), while enforcing valid URLs for active tools.

Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout with smooth animations and a fixed navbar for easy navigation.

Export Tools: Export the tool list as a JSON file for backup or sharing.

Icon Customization: Choose from 10 Font Awesome icons with distinct color schemes for visual appeal.

Admin Interface: Dedicated section for managing tools, with validation, error alerts, and detailed import feedback.

Legal & Connect: Includes Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and contact/feedback sections.
